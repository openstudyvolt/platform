# 🤖 Chapter 12: AI Integration & Prompt Engineering

## 🎯 Overview

Open Study Volt (OSV) incorporates AI to enhance summarization, question generation, contextual chat, and personalized learning experiences. This chapter outlines how we integrate AI systems and structure prompt engineering workflows.

## 🧠 AI Use Cases

| Use Case           | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Summarization      | Extracts and condenses uploaded documents/videos |
| Quiz Generation    | Adaptive questions based on learner level        |
| AI Chat Assistant  | Context-aware tutor, multilingual                |
| Recommendations    | Suggests materials based on previous usage       |

---

## 🛠 AI Architecture

- All AI requests proxied through **Ollama** gateway
- Async flow via Laravel Queues
- Embeddings stored in **Qdrant**
- Prompt templates versioned and stored in Git

### Request Flow

```plaintext
User → API Upload → Queue Job → Prompt Builder → LLM via Ollama → Save → Respond
```

## 🧩 Prompt Engineering

| Area           | Pattern                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Summarization  | System + Context + Compressed Text     |
| Quiz Generator | System + Topic + Level + Output Format |
| Chat Assistant | System Persona + Previous Messages     |

### Prompt Format Example

```json
{
  "system": "You are an expert educational assistant.",
  "input": "This document is a lecture on the French Revolution...",
  "instructions": "Summarize in 5 points for a 12-year-old reader."
}
```

## 🔄 Prompt Lifecycle

1. Template created by Content Strategist
2. Reviewed by Prompt Engineer
3. Versioned under `resources/prompts/`
4. Indexed by a use-case in metadata
5. A/B tested via feature flag rollout

---

## 🧪 AI Test Strategy

- Prompt output unit tested with golden fixtures
- AI Assistant evaluated via simulated chat logs
- Hallucination detection: length deviation, fuzzy matching
- Language variants verified by native-speaking reviewers

---

## ⚙️ LLMs & Hosting

| Component      | Platform                    |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Ollama Gateway | Self-hosted API proxy       |
| Whisper API    | Speech → text transcription |
| Embeddings     | Local model or OpenAI       |
| Vector Store   | Qdrant                      |

---

## 🔐 AI Data Compliance

- Prompt logs anonymized before storage
- All user content is removed from the LLM cache
- LLM queries scrubbed for PII
- Prompt injection protection: strict escaping

---

## 🧠 AI Engineer Notes

> “Every AI request is an interaction with user trust. We log prompts, version templates, and never let the LLM guess unsupervised.”

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- Ollama, Whisper API
- Laravel Queues
- Qdrant
- Faker for prompt simulations

# Login Feature Implementation

This document summarizes the steps performed to implement the email/password login feature with a **Remember Me** option.

## Overview

The existing codebase already included Laravel's built-in authentication routes and UI using Inertia and React. After confirming there was no `.junie` directory containing additional instructions, the following tasks were completed:

1. Reviewed authentication controllers and React pages to ensure an email, password and `remember` checkbox are present.
2. Confirmed the login request uses Laravel's `Auth::attempt` with the `remember` flag.
3. Added an automated Pest test verifying that checking the `remember` option sets the recaller cookie.

## Testing

Automated tests could not be executed in this environment because PHP and Composer dependencies are absent by default and network restrictions block retrieving Composer. The added test should pass in a full Laravel environment.

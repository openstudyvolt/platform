# Forgot Password Feature Report

## Overview

This update introduces the complete password reset workflow. Users can request a password reset link, receive an email, and set a new password using the provided token.

## Implementation Details

- **Controller**: Added `ForgotPasswordController` which handles displaying the request form, sending reset links, showing the token-based form and updating the password.
- **Routes**: Updated `routes/auth.php` to route all password reset endpoints through this controller.
- **Frontend**: React pages `forgot-password.tsx` and `reset-password.tsx` already provide the forms using Inertia and Tailwind.
- **Email**: `resources/views/emails/auth/reset-password.blade.php` sends a link that expires according to the `auth` config.
- **Testing**: Added a Pest test covering the full reset flow including database update and notification.

## Rationale

Consolidating the password reset logic in a single controller simplifies maintenance while leveraging Laravel's built-in password broker for security. The automated test ensures the process works end to end.

# Crews

This directory contains multi-agent configurations built using the [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) framework.

Each subdirectory represents a focused crew with a simple Python entrypoint using CrewAI.

- **Development_Crew** – handles product development tasks.
- **Business_Analytics_Crew** – explores data and generates insights.
- **Software_Engineering_Crew** – supports engineering workflows.
- **Website_Crew** – assists with building and maintaining the website.

To run a crew, install dependencies and execute its main script, e.g.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Development_Crew/main.py
```
